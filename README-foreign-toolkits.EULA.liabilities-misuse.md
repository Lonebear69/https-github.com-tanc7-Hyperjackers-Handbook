### GENERAL ###

Credit should be given to the ones that originally conceived and released these modules such as Team Offensive Security, Rapid7, Hak5, Lister Unlimited Cybersecurity Solutions, LLC. (my company).

For the most part, what I stashed here were either from a foreign entity to which due credit should be given to THEM (not me). 

### MY OWN COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM LULLC ###

However, I did design the interaction modules and interactive shells as well as convenience tools like (Trademarked) ArmsCommander, Cylon-Raider, Abominable-Intelligence, the AutoExploiting Pi (which is the free, open-source edition of A.I. of the former).

Whatever you find from this directory is entirely free to use. Whatever is here  is of MY design (check the folder Lister-Unlimited, was intentionally left here because it's the Open-Source Components of my design.

### DEFINING 'PREMIUM OFFERING' IN COMPARISON TO THE OPEN-SOURCE OFFERINGS I HAVE PROVIDED HERE ###

By downloading and installing the Hyperjacker's Toolkit, you have acknowledged that you have read and understood these terms. The only conditions I expect you to abide by is...

**Due to the contents of this directory being entirely 'Open-Source', with the exception of the credited firm's PREMIUM and DISTINCT OFFERINGS**

For example, 

$1,500 for Abominable Intelligence as a flat fee from Lister Unlimited Cybersecurity Solutions, LLC., 
$3,000 to $20,000 for a annual Metasploit Pro Subscription from Rapid7, 
$6,000 for two ANNUAL user-licenses of Cobalt Strike Pentesting GUIs from Strategic Cyber, LLC.
$100 for a Wi-Fi Pineapple from Hak5 or maybe a Bash Bunny

These are goods and services offered by all of us that are separate and distinctly identifiable, identified as a PREMIUM offering (between a automatic wireless hacking raspberry pi with full automatic post-exploition and a 17-mile range antenna, a guaranteed subscription as a member of the bleeding edge exploits offered by Rapid7 Pentesters, the license that acknowledges and confirms the usage rights of a Remote-Exploitation and Pivoting Framework for TWO recipients, and finally, a Multi-Functioning Wireless Exploitation, Pentesting, Packet Sniffing, and Payload HID Injection Toolkit)

All four(5) products are ACTUALLY PREMIUM OFFERINGS that are SEPARATE and DISTINCTLY identifiable. And although the Open-Source Repositories were the birthplaces and proving grounds of our research, we declare them SEPARATE and DISTINCT from what we offer as merchandise, goods, and services. 

Each and every one of us aforementioned entities (LULLC d.b.a Lister Unlimited, Hak5,LLC., Rapid7, Strategic Cyber among many more) have advanced far beyond the capabilities of our open source offerings, and we intend to release these select goods and services with the intent of making a profit.

You may use(misuse) the Open-Source repositories as you wish, as long as you agree that...

### TERMS ###

you, as the license holder, SHALL NOT attempt to package for resale...

	1. Shall not attempt to resell any component or redistribute for personal gain or profit, of ANY of the Lister Unlimited's credited Open-Source Intellectual Property.
        2. Shall not attempt to resell any component or redistribute for personal gain or profit, of ANY of the Contributing Open-Source Intellectual Property. Hak5, LLC. for example will fall in this category.
	3. By installing the Open-Source repository from the GitHub source, you have been transferred the majority of the legal and civil liabilties to yourself as a result of what may be criminal acts, incarceration, physical/mental damage and financial harm done to others or yourself. We will not be held accountable for irresponsible misuse of what is explicitly labeled as a toolkit for professional penetration testers and personnel.
	4. The remainder of the "Liabilities" will complete the transfer to the Licensee upon the signature of the Responsible Use Agreement, upheld by a free-to-obtain, SHA-256 Generated Hash "License Number". This Hash code is the only forensically identifiable information that could be linked to you in the event that we, Lister Unlimited (d.b.a.), AKA Lister Unlimited Cybersecurity Solutions, LLC. were to be implicated or held to testify before the Court of Law.

*In condition number four, what this basically amounts to, is that after "unlocking" your toolkit using our hash keys, you now have legally accepted FULL CRIMINAL & CIVIL responsibilities, including consequences of the abuse, misuse, misplacement, and intentional weaponized deployment of potentially devastating malware variants.

**Also, any attempt to illegally crack the key to unlock the framework's more advanced capabilities (cmon, why the hell would you do that?!? It's a free license! Go tell your pal to download his or her own copy!) INVALIDATES our share of the liability. We no longer have ANY responsibility at that moment once we realize that the key or license was illegally obtained, cracked, or forged.

In the Court of Law, whether it be a State, Federal, or a State/Federal Supreme Court, we will confirm whether or not your hash key is legitimate by comparing it in our registered license database. 

In other words, if you actually drop my fucking name in the courthouse AFTER you signed OUR agreement, and you fucking say it's MY FAULT. I am going to kick your ass from that courthouse back to Gettysburg.
