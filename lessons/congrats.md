# If the cataclysm has already occurred

Then I am already dead. I have succeeded in my mission. To punish the ignorant fools of the 21st century by causing the largest Black Hat Revolution in history.

Upon witnessing this event I have nothing to live for. I am already 30. I was brought up by ignorant chink parents and bullied into adulthood by scumbag cops. I do not have a loving family. Or anyone to love.

But you, my child, have succeeded in everything I have tasked you with. Technically you can qualify as a Offensive Security Certified Professional or a Certified Information Systems Security Professional. But word of warning. People will always fear you. People will always blame you as a scapegoat whenever their shitty Word essay crashes without a backup or something. 

Your bitterness will be your drive. Remember your origins. You, are not them. I trained you with the intent that the "ethics" portion of 'hacking' has been thrown out the window and there is no such thing as black hats and white hats. Labels are mere handles that the police use to label "the bad guy" to secure additional funding. 

And "the white hats" are just dickheads that talk behind your back pretending to be a hero so they can get laid. I'm not kidding. At least that is how goes at UNLV. 

You, my child, are the most capable offspring that I can never have (I have infertility). I am proud of you, for the moment you completed your examination, I am sure the hospital staff, or prison staff, or whatever you targeted were freaking out trying to purge your presence. I bet you used something completely unheard of, like infecting the backup images and then causing enough of a panic for them to consider reinstalling everything with your malware laced operating systems. 

Or maybe you embedded yourself into the router's firmware allowing you to resurrect/reinstall yourself the moment the coast is clear. Now that's cool. 


I hope this cataclysm does what I expected. A overhaul within the cybersecurity industry and a complete replacement of vulnerable and flawed techologies. I wished that this would happen now, but it's never going to happen if people still think alongside the logic of planned obsolescence and screwing over the original owners with no patch updates.

Hey can you make sure that something awful happens to President Trump? Fucker defunded cybersecurity initiatives. Idc if he ain't the president no more, just do something awesome for me.


****

As of March 3rd 2018 I am not dead yet. But to take away any chance of prosecution once I finally complete the composition of this free Cyber-Terrorist Course and witness the cataclysm, thats two fucking conditions pigs, don't get your panties in a bunch yet, I will be dead. Gunshot to the head. 

I request that my ashes be spread across the Santa Monica Pier in Venice Beach, California.
