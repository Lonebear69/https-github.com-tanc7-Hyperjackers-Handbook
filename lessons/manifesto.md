# Lister Unlimited: "Revolutionizing Cyber-Terrorism"

# A lot of you are perplexed on how and why, I Chang Tan (d.b.a Chang Tan Lister), the founder and owner of a Cybersecurity company no older than a year, is apparently intentionally teaching to any curious newcomers out there, all for free apparently.
```
1. The black arts of
2. So called 'hacking'
3. With the ability to attack all known Windows hosts to boot
4. And the art of evading law enforcement CHFI (Computer Hacking Forensic Investigators)
5. That looked underneath the same rock and not the other
6. How to seize control of commercially sized hypervisors hosted in "the cloud"
7. Giving you full control over the future of...
8. A couple hundred to a thousand helpless souls that hosted their livelihoods
9. Their futures
10. Their businesses
11. Their retirement funds
12. Their family photos
13. In that pathetic
14. and Gigantic Fucking box
15. That they entrusted full control to some asshole on the intarwebs

# Because I am under duress god fucking damnit.

So this cop at UNLV thinks I am some sort of malicious hacker. And that I apparently have nothing better to do than to troll cops and stay on the run.

I am on my last stretch with just one class until graduation. It's called Accounting 402. Unfortunately, I have spent the last month, since February 4th, trying to get away from some nosey wannabe hacker (skiddies actually) geeks that have been following me from the TBE engineering building to the Lied Library nmap scanning me, fingering me (I am not kidding, it's both a UNIX and Windows Command),  and provoking me to defend myself using what I know, and what I built my business on.

I suspect that the pig at the UNLVPD Police Department was attempting to provoke me. At the time, I was researching on behalf of one of my employers, the likelihood of a attacker seizing control of his Docker Containers that manage his web apps. That inspired something in me, and I later learned from a few weeks of research that the biggest bounty is a full-scale hyperjacking of a Cloud VPS server. And that the study as well as the launch of a Hyperjacking Course could reel me in some huge money (because I am the first guy that officially announced such a course, this topic is pretty much hush hush in the last few years since cloud storage really took off, make no mistake, the relatively few numbers of attacking hyperjackers versus CIRT response teams are among the most powerful in the world. To even qualify to work in this subsector of cybersecurity requires a very firm understanding of the most basic expressions in code such as Assembly).

But now, my attention in my work has been diverted into fending off these little shits, losing precious time, money, and my last chance to pass Accounting with a degree all at once. The moment the situation really got bad was on February 28th, when I realized that at least, THREE professional penetration testers have now began stalking me. Then I fucking snapped.
```
I am 70,000 in student loan debt.
I am 30 years old and barely even got off my feet.
I still have not filed my federal taxes because I spent so much time fending you little wanna hacker fucks away.
My mother contracted a terminal cancer less than two weeks ago, and she has MAX 5 years left to live frfom squabbius carcinoma.
My father is 80 years old. Look him up pigs. He was born in May 1944.
And you think it's fucking funny to drive me to ruin?
You know those bums out in the street in Vegas? They were people just like me. And every person who had a nice car, loving wife, and a family, well those wretches were the ones that drove that bums into homelessness.

There is no such thing as a good person. You are your own worst enemy. And you will die with every sin embedded into your conciousness. But me, I seek not to.

You see, I am a felon. I do not have the ability to get a job, and don't believe any cop or probation officer that says that I can (a job to them sounds like eternal damnation pushing carts at Walmart to pay off supervision fees). So I created my own job. I am the Manager (you will address me as Manager or Managing Member, NEVER Chairman or CEO) of a cybersecurity firm called Lister Unlimited Cybersecurity Firm, LLC. It is legally registered in the State of Nevada and in the City of Las Vegas. But a bunch of pigs with a old grudge against me wants to see this vision destroyed.

I don't even have time to get my business done or to launch my Udemy course, the Cyberwarfare Instructor program (for a full list ofk offerings from Lister Unlimited Cybersecurity Solutions, LLC. please visit listerunlimited.com and inquire about our online Web Application Firewall deals provided by our Partner-Reseller Arrangement with Incapsula-Imperva, we offer monthly discounts of up to 25% that will be passed to you, our valued customer).

# I have decided to intentionally give UNLV, a REAL PROBLEM.

I am going to train, arm, and mobilize every curious motherfucker from UNLV to across the nation, the capability to perform a cyberattack across the entire kill-chain, from initial recon to landing a shell, to post-exploitation and pivoting to the next impressionable little fuck that made up some shit about me hacking (I am talking about you, fat sorority bitch at the student union). The goal is to enable someone like YOU, regardless of age, gender or creed, to perform devastating cyber-attacks on whatever makes your dick hard.

I know you hate a lot of people. Thats why you looked up hacking. Because you got a hitlist already drawn up and done don't you? And you want to get even. No. Not even. You want to rout your enemies and them driven before your feet. I can get you started on causing some real trouble, something that actually would benefit ME, because more panic in the cybersecurity industry means more phone calls of distress on my business line, means more business.

I will try my best to shatter any illusions or discouraging factors that you may have had. There are a lot of misinformed dumbshits out there. That spread misinformation. It could be, I guess, something done as a cybersecurity measure. Spoon fed lies, to keep you dumb. Dumber than sheep. Dumb as human. You didn't think going to college is worth anything did you? I followed my parent's lies. Look where I am now.

You will become the launchpad for my career. You havn't even read this page in it's entirety because I know you wanted to learn about getting even. I will make a cyber-soldier out of you.

# And it's NOT "getting-even". It's "getting-hard" ;)

Show us some love on Facebook, for our newest penetration testing toolkit in the making, the Abominable Intelligence Auto-Exploiting Raspberry Pi. Complete with a massive parabolic antenna that exerts a range of 17 miles across the City of Las Vegas using dual-RF amplifiers

# About our insane founder. The self-styled Father of Cyber-Terrorism.

Note about our founder Chang Tan Lister. He is a paranoid schizophrenic (that probably isnt) that was ordered to go on meds by the judge and is currently on probation for a road-rage related event a year earlier that the cops never bothered to enforce the traffic law on (the same exact UNLVPD Cops). He really is heading to a life of ruin and he is determined to make at least, the darker part of his agenda as described in these writings, a reality. He is going to get himself killed via suicide-by-cop since he is unarmed facing off against a entire department of what he calls, "pigs" pursuing him for the last half a year over unproven and unsubstantiated hacking allegations.

He bases this outcome on... mainly trigger happy cops that have populated the City of Las Vegas for the last decade or so. One shot gunned down a guy with a baseball bat. Another one got gunned down by narcs while taking a dump. As far as we can see, disturbingly, our employer may be right.

Another ideas he has mentioned is, go "rob a gun store" after "stealing a semi truck" and head off to perform his "kill-chain", including a pretentious faggot hipster coffee shop owner that started all this (the "faggot" as CTL refers to him as, doesn't how real hacking works, also Lister claimed that the person doesn't trim his nosehairs and it wiggles as he talks. He describes it as a perfect blend of white tinge and a bit of golden to blonde on the edges)

He also requested that this agenda, to create a much darker environment for IT will "persist" as he says, even if he dies. That means, he gave all of us, a direct order to continue this research effort and "public information campaign", on what will be a wildly popular and abused vector of attack to come. Because he claims 'it's good for business, on both ends'.

America has been subjected to hacker-phobia without understanding the difference between hackers and crackers. Since the fear portion of hacking has been  satisfied, all that is needed is to cause the cataclysm.

# Just for LE

If you inquire to people who knew CTL further in his colorful background back to the early 2000's, you would quickly know that this Lister individual hides a lot more than what he says for obvious reasons (to not get gunned down as quickly, and for 'a tactical embrace').

For one, at nineteen years of age, he enlisted in the United States Marines in 2007 with the MOS Motor Vehicle Operator. He also can and has, disarmed armed opponents holding a range of weapons against him, between 45 caliber pistols to 12 gauge shotguns in the backseat of cramped vehicles like some "dinky pos hooptie civic" (if you learned about his distant associates).

He knows the fastest way to securing a weapon is to bait his opponents into a more convenient range by methods such as requesting a comforting hug. Duh. Even former officers are quite aware of what he's capable of. Like a fellow former marine who ended up becoming a campus cop, and famously led cops on a high speed chase on centennial parkway, DUI, hunndred pills and a loaded gun.

However he is "getting quite old". And despairing that apparently people his age still be startin' shit. Including some, (he's referring to queermos are a coffee shop) approximately 47 year old "fag" that wants to send false allegations to cops about his alleged hacking activities.

We will repeat this one more time, he does not have the time or motivation to "do this shit anymore". But he also knows this is his only chance before he ends up growing "too old".

Either way, he is determined not to lose. And very 'excited' to learn of a opportunity to bait the police into gunning him down. Probably "turning the lights on a laptop on in a threatening manner" as well as stoking as much misconception about hacking as possible. He will be laughing at the OIS hearing on top of his little cloud and halo in heaven.

# Using a Command Prompt is NOT hacking. Remember that.

Just make sure you get a good lawyer. I can't afford one thanks to pigs arresting me all the time even while running a legitimate business. Cops can't tell the difference between command prompts and hacking so they'll throw you in prison for a quick score on their quota.
