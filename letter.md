# Did I get my six-star wanted level yet?

**I am going to gun down each and every "graduate" at this year's Graduation Ceremony on May 12th.**

**You brought me and my family to ruin even though I was trying to make a honest living**

1. By making **defamatory remarks** about my company
2. By **calling in the FBI** to take $5,500 of my stuff
3. By calling me a **malicious hacker**
4. By driving my company to **bankruptcy**
5. By **conspiring to put me in prison** for no fuckign reason except that you wanted to impress some girl
6. **Even the fucking public library accused me of being a hacker, after I was running for my life because some weirdo was taking notes on me at the computer lab and I lost my shit, pursued by UNLVPD and Metro across the city**. The only innocence I was granted was from this sweet lady that served as the CHFI for Metro, who had surrounded the building guns drawn. She proved that I was not hacking and instead had issues with my wireless card. **I liked her, I hoped to meet her someday. Dance with her at Stoneys or something.**
7. **I am at my last chance to pass a class**, that you are causing me to fail.


Yeah I am a felon, but I am not without access to guns. It's easy. A lot of gun shops are not properly secured. No barricades, fences, or poles. And if it's not coming from this state, it'll be coming from the next state. I know this one place that has gun ownership at 4-to-1 per person. That includes if you counted the children as gun owning adults. And every one of these hillbilly gun shops is protected by no more than regular glass. Google Maps is a great source to assess gun shop security. 

Getting a gun is easy. And there is more than one way to bypass a background check. You can attach bullets to arrows. It's been around for hundreds of years, called "Bang Sticks". Formerly, a different type is known as a "Powerhead", which is attached to spears to kill sharks.

**My mother is going to die in less than 5 years** from a skin cancer, Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
**My father is actually eighty years old**. And he will die soon.
**I am indebted by more than $60,000.**

And all you can do is talk shit about me and call the FBI because I have a computer terminal out? I hope that fuck you scored with that bimbo was worth it, ahahaha.

I am going to kill each and every one of you.

You must think I come from a weaker race or something. Since each person bitching about me at the Student Union is white. My parents are weak, no doubt, which enabled you to continue to do harm to me without a means to defend myself. No money for lawyers. 

**But this time I am going to be laughing to a early ticket to heaven.**


If it's not going to be a gun its going to be a car. Remember that. I have full control over life and death and certainly not you, or the pathetic, pee-wee cybersecurity squad that was stalking me at UNLV.

**All I wanted was to be alone forever and build my company. But all you fucks forced my hand.**

# Sunrise Library Siege


I can remember that lady as clear as day. 

**But earlier on, there was some weird British sounding guy that was taking notes on me at the UNLV Computer Lab, Thomas Engineering Building. Every time I started typing for my code (Python), the dude counts 3 seconds and begins typing**. I tested it several times, immediately stopped and pretended to think. He stops. I start typing again... he counts to 3, and starts typing. Typing ON, typing OFF, for two hours straight. Every once and a while he would get up and make a remark to the Lab Monitor about me, "Is he really _____? He looks like more a Computer Science Major".

Like some motherfucking cartoon.

I had enough of that shit. I hurled something across the lab (a can I think) and every head turned at me. The guy bailed out the lab after I finished my smoke. I was scanning the immediate area for eavesdroppers. When I got back to my desk, **I took a very lengthy glance at the clipboard he tore the original copy off of, it says "Technical Evaluation" on the top heading**. He left his shit logged in on his Desktop, but every window was closed. Do cops run "Technical Evaluations" on strangers while stalking them? You know, for "investigating"?

**I did not feel safe. I quickly packed up my bags and left. It was February 28th, and it's morning rush, students pouring in from two massively long snakes of cars from both Cottage Grove and Claymont**. Fortunately the traffic pressure is only TO the school and not OUT, so I quickly sped my way out. Strangely, the Ka-band signals from police traffic radar was only at "nominal rush hour levels" and nothing to imply that there is a active pursuit. 

They're letting me go.

But I still drove like I was being chased. The police recently encrypted their radios preventing me from directly discerning their intents. https://lasvegassun.com/news/2018/feb/05/metro-puts-end-to-people-listening-in-on-police-ra/

**I am extremely sleep deprived. Coding for 12 hours. I found 2 voicemails from my Probation Officer when I stopped several miles east of my neighborhood**. At the time my phone CANNOT receive calls due to some retarded bug with Android Oreo. But I have to reestablish contact, as per terms of probation.

**I arrived at Sunrise Library looking for a hotspot to write a email back to my PO**. I had my terminal out to manually activate my wireless card to connect. I had major issues getting internet to work so I wrote a script that automates

1. Association
2. Authentication
3. DHCP Leases
4. Routing
5. DNS



**Then I overheard the staff whispering about a "a hacker" and that "they notified the cops"**. My heart tensed at the prospect of the chase resuming.

Half an hour later. I overheard yelling at the entrance, and cops preventing people from leaving.

The best I could do is start up Windows in KVM and then expand the screen. I had homework due in a day anyways. Planned to wait this misunderstanding out.

**Then she came. She was wearing a black suit, blond hair, and had a laptop in her purse**. She had a few words with the fat dude. She then sat down at the center of the library and opened up her notebook. She got back up, requested to enter the back room for IT and didn't come out until fifteen minutes later.

When she got back out. **She pointed out that I was innocent** (whispering back to the fat dude). That I was simply trying to connect with broken WiFi drivers. She wanted to talk to me in person but hesitated because she knew I was scared.

She even called me cute (to the IT) on her way out.

I counted down from 20 minutes to make sure the coast is clear. **I been holding in my pee for hours until this bs ended and it's about 2 or 3 pm. The library was opened at 10am.**



She even called me cute. **I overheard her in the distance, explaining to the fat guy (library IT) that I was having wireless card issues and I was hiding behind a virtual machine**. When the fat dude asked how I am able to hide in a virtual machine that no one can enter on their Network, she said "because he is a cyber security guy" with a smile. She wanted to say something to me, but decided to let me go and she knew I was very alarmed.

**I was sitting there. Frozen. Rereading the same exact fucking sentence in my class online homework**. Focusing my hearing on the exact conversation. You try this while there are so many distractions and sick old people around you.

**Since she left, all of the library staff kept on chatting. About me. I became the talk the entire afternoon**. I needed a smoke break (and pee break), and the library staff was chatting about me, even pointed at me "look that's him!".

I do not like that. I am a fucking freak now. Driven to ruin by people's dumb-as-shit fantasies of what "Hackers look like".

**There is NO sanctuary for me. Not in my house. Not outside. Nowhere.**


# The only "love letter" you will ever get.

**To that lady. I truly appreciate that you proved my innocence to the masses** of ignorant, technically inept motherfuckers that continually conspire to ruin me. Even when I am trying to contact my PO at a public library.

**And I love you for that.** Also, you're hot.

**But that is merely a moment in time.** And time always changes.


I'll explain why... Aside from the fact that I'm a felon, our differences and past choices have effectively turned us into enemies in our society. And for that reason, **I will always assume that you are attempting to build a new case against if I ever see you again.**

Just like Metro, UNLVPD, and the FBI.

I have no idea why you chose to work with law enforcement, **I think that for each cop that joins the force, there is a moment where they reach a "realization" a few years down in their careers**. That the problems that they signed up to confront will only get worse.

**Then, the darker, career damaging traits begin to manifest**. It first starts as disillusionment and cynicism. Then to substance abuse, usually drinking. If they resisted suicide, then they will be tempted by something much worse. Corruption, bribery, interactions with criminal elements, you name it.

**I personally knew a police officer by the name of Joseph Lawrance.** Spelled with a 'a'. He was originally a North Las Vegas police officer that eventually worked for College of Southern Nevada. You could best describe our mutual knowledge and relationship as extremely heated.

He eventually ended up working for Henderson before something happened.

**Somehow, in the years gone by, he made local headlines after being pulled over with hundreds of painkillers, the smell of alcohol, and a loaded gun**. And I do not know what caused him to think it's a good idea, but he then sped off in a truck and led cops on a high speed chase along centennial parkway, even into oncoming traffic.

http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/26887943/report-henderson-officer-had-whiskey-pills-loaded-gun-in-truck

I never learned how this story ended up. He got sentenced to a lengthy probation term but I don't know the aftermath. I do wish him good luck.


**The point I am trying to make is that.. I think you chose the wrong career.** Something happened to him that only he knows. From our personal interactions, he had implied he has seen far worse. Both in his career in the Marines, and on the streets prior to wearing a badge.

That something could happen to any LEO. And it will irrevocably change them. It could be anything, like busting a prostitution ring, or taking a nasty fall and being forced to take powerful painkillers.

**You should be working for PRIVATE entities. Better pay, benefits, and you will be set at the front line of most major cyberattacks. That is, the corporate sector.**

# My last few moments

I have seen my own fair share of horrors, but this last year of late 2017, to right now, was the most pivotal.

**So I met this girl at the library. Not you maam (the CHFI lady at Sunrise Library)**. She smiled, we exchanged numbers, and I went to what I thought was a innocent date. Her name is Nadia. She spoke very good _______ and she committed herself to learning it, impressing my father when I finally introduced her.

**In one month, I learned she lived a double life as a prostitute outside of her gig as a dancer for Little Darlings, that she is hopelessly addicted to heroin and methamphetamine**, and that she is forever entrapped in a web of lies and manipulation between various drug dealers and pimps, and what I believe are vice cops. Her father won't even trust her with his house keys.

**It took me one month to find the strength to call it off with her**. I found out she convinced a old flame (apparently he was her heroin dealer) to break into some random guys house. At the time, I thought it was MY house. 

I felt that if I continually chose to associate with her, that I was going to die somewhere. 

My only memories, are sex tapes that we mutually made. It's now in the hands of the FBI that probably going to leverage it as "dirt" against me.

**In that time, Metro has hunted me down for months while I was trying to get on with my life and schoolwork done**. Under false accusations such as... Pimping, narcotics, illegal hacking, and various counts of police evasion. I have failed my last class and i am going to fail my last chance this semester. 

I have intentionally let my mind slip into insanity. Because I have nothing to lose. 

**They have since, forwarded the case to the FBI**. After a very awkward dinner at Taco Y Taco on Tropicana. With my new shoes coated in my neighbor's dog shit. 

Since that time, Metro and only Metro encrypted their police radios with P25 Motorolas. That effectively made me blind, which enabled the FBI to raid my home half a year later.

**Nevertheless, I developed my own countermeasures**. It's called a $15 Faraday bag, as well as a metal clipboard with five layers of aluminum foil. You take my ass to the dollar store, I can turn you invisible.

Toss your phone in either, double wrap the enclosure, and live free with that fact that you can no longer be "pinged", which is what Metro uses to geolocate me with a fake phone call. Combine this with police scanners and radar detectors for maximum effect.

**Please check the undersides of your vehicle for magnetically attached GPS trackers. Like, REALLY REACH IN there and start tugging at things**. Pop your hood and follow every positive battery lead. If you can find a spectrum analyzer (radio), turn it on, point it across your entire car. Are there "hotspots" where it shouldn't be "transmitting"? 

GPS trackers come in two types. Cellular network and true GPS. cellular based is battery heavy, and highly inaccurate. True GPS is much more expensive but can pinpoint you down to the exact parking spot.

**At the end of this fluff, you do realize all I wanted is a normal life right?**

# Until recently, I was fending off LEO at a serious advantage to maintain my innocence

**Wanna see how much I know about your 400 codes?**

**You have accused me of being high on 446, and that I suffer from PTSD and extremely 421A. You also said over the radio that I am 440 on multiple counts of 432 which have no basis.** The accuser is this pretentious 40-something year-old queertron that owns a hipster coffee shop. 

**He has a stocky build, is a total asshole to his own employees (potentially violating labor laws), and he DOES NOT TRIM HIS NOSEHAIRS**. I have seen shades of blonde, white, and black hanging from his left nostril when he made retarded assed accusations that I was "hacking" his wifi just because my Linux build was unable to connect. I later learned that the real cause of the issue was crappy wireless drivers in the dogshit state of Linux today. His dumb fucking mouth is the root cause of all of the troubles I am having today. And if I am not dead, you guido motherfucker, then I will be in prison, and I will be suing you, your wife, your daughter, and every one of your weird relatives that I saw that one day. **Oh yeah, and there is a illegal drug distribution drug ring that is operating there. Adderall, Molly (I actually only remember them as pressed pills in my time), LSD, and possibly SOME had drugs. Go send a narc as a "local resident" to this coffee shop. You'll end up promoting him. The owner doesn't know.**

As for easily breaking police perimeters, I quietly observed your formations when you tried to arrest me, at the time I was able to hear any and all radio transmissions via a phone app.

"Alright, I want a unit on Stewart and Lamb, Bonanza and Lamb, Nellis and Bonanza, Charleston and Lamb, Bonanza and Page..."

Awesome. Lemme just pull over in this dark stretch of roadway and start writing those intersections down. Then write myself a route list and tape it to the top of my sun visor.

I do appreciate your dispatchers comments saying that my build is extremely muscular, These crazy pills make me fat. Gotta lose that fat somehow. But I do not like your remarks on my tendency to enter into 416s. Do NOT call me extremely violent. DO NOT listen to the wannabe cybersecurity fags at UNLV. They have NO training, not even the FREE training I obtained from online institutions. If I find these fuckers, they are gonna be the first dead bitches.



# Actual experience levels

**I do not rely on 413s, as I prefer stealth, cover, and ambushes. Beat cops are "walking armories"**, equipped with handguns, pepper spray, batons, tasers, handcuffs, and as much reloadable ammo that I can find. I have formal training in the Marines (I have a pre-existing condition that dashed my chances), and I formerly knew a special forces operator that used to live in Reno. "Andrew", if I could recall. He used to live in Vegas a decade ago.

Before he joined the military, he has this collapsible baton he would always whip out and flash his martial arts moves at the downtown coffee shop.

Other colorful characters include, a former SWCC ("Swick"), Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crew member, US Army signals intelligence Sergeant (my ex, her in-law is Jeff Li, one of the Commanding Officers of United States Cyber Command), and a Marine Corps Combat Engineer who has a speed impediment from a shrapnel wound from a IED blast.

**The last guy, Chris, the stories he tells me. He lost his chances of being promoted anywhere higher than Sergeant due to... Hilarious things** like breaking up with his girl that happens to be the commanding officers daughter. And he is STILL able to pick up women despite the neck wound and voice.

But the initial meet the parents moment was quite romantic. "Daddy" actually brought two MPs to his house to escort Chris to his BBQ for the first meet. Complete with open bottles of beer and hamburgers. 

Don't get me wrong, Chris is a great friend. And he is a incredibly smart guy. But people misinterpret him as some sort of "bonehead". In rare moments I have received very surprising words of wisdom from this guy.

**The SIGINT is a girl that I dated for nearly two years**. We had a tumultuous and costly breakup. But I want to say, "Hello, I wish you well" or something if you can contact her.

I also know a Military Police Officer from Reno in the Army that trained me, along with the Combat Engineer, the Operator, and my own training. I took what I knew, and reversed MCMAP into a newer imitation form of LINE. Linear Infighting Neural Override Engagement.

One of my former managers in my old jobs (Michael Kors) was a Air Force MP. She liked me until she found out I was a probationer because she peeped my phone notifications on break in 2012, according to a coworker. Either way she couldn't fire me. Erhurhurhurhur. $11 an hour for selling handbags was good pay at the time.

**All of these people have now entered new beautiful chapters in their lives. Why can't I?**

Because you fuckers won't leave me alone, that's why.

My rumors, both true and untrue and spread by every high and drunk loudmouth in the valley has turned me into the Most Infamous Psychotic "Hacker" in Las Vegas. But you could confirm what I said by tracing my background and my associates and formers since 2006.

All I wanted is a normal fucking life. You are determined to deny me this?

**I think I lived my colorful life to its unexpected potential. I can die now**. Knowing that I'll make it to heaven regardless. I'll be happily sitting on top of my cloud eating bagels and cream cheese watching you fucks burn in hell.

Do you know how hot hell gets? To Pain and Suffering. The only measurable climate of hell.

# The people I wished I never met.

**In the meantime, while these people are significant individuals in my life, I have known countlessly more "darker elements". People,  that I cannot shake off no matter how hard I try.** A man that is a decade older than me, that mentored me in the drug trade that I was originally caught up for in 2011, has still continued, to this day, continually fuck things up for himself on a worse level than me. This man, is practically my Executive Officer and Enforcer a decade ago. He is my comrade. Much like how cops would have a fraternal relationship with one another, or how military personnel would have such a relationship after discharge.

**This man, since I have officially "dismissed" him as required by probation in 2012, has since then been sued repeatedly for child support alimonies, racked up numerous domestic violence charges, and many attorneys and public defenders have deeply regret ever working for him**. He has always maintained his habit of constantly getting fired from whatever job he scored, and even his sister detests him and believed that there is no salvation for him. As of right now, he is slowly dying from some sort of respiratory dysfunction. I seen the X-Rays he put on social media.

**In the last passing year, this man attempted to reinvolve me back into the narcotics trade against my will**. I just started probation. Doing a bit of research, I found signs on social media that he relapsing into methamphetamine abuse, both by his own words and by angry accusations by others.

**Had this man, came back from out of state, and forced me to sling again... I would have killed him**. I would be forced to tearfully kill my former right-hand man. The only person I knew, that could reliably "get things done".

**Because he was going to fuck things up for me too.**

Can you do that? To kill your Lieutenant? Your Executive Officer? **A interesting fact, both of us, fucked "the same girl" four times over**. That is, either I started and broke off the relationship with a girl before breaking up and passed her over to him, or the other way around. Star, Rachel, Rhianna, and Sarah. I remember each name.

**In my last bid to restore his sanity, I finally got through with him. Without ever revealing my intents. Until the moment this email arrived into your inbox.**

**As for any LEOs after my former Lieutenant for God knows what he has done now. Word of warning.** Do not underestimate him. He is the most unlikely and strongest hand-to-hand combatant that I have ever known. He is the one that developed the core (with me, as a mutual effort) of the Reverse-Engineered LINE Combat System with a Keysi Method Base. 

**On his right knee, is a gunshot wound. There is another one in his abdomen that exited from his back**. These incidents happened a full DECADE before I was even a adult. You will have to ask him to let him tell you what happened in perfect detail. He actually cannot get a full 8-hour rest at any point in time. He suffers a worse condition of PTSD from the height of the gang-violence in the late 90s. I accidentally stepped on him while he was sleeping in a sleeping bag in the living room, by reflex he hurled me against a cheap apartment pillar while lying down. The hole the back of my head left into the wall is still there at that crappy apartment complex.

I cannot take him back. Even if I ever to live and see the sunlight after being released from my cell in my eighties. He will not receive a position in whatever my company has become or crumbled into. To ensure that I am safe from further mishaps.

But if I am dead, for reasons outside of my control... he still remembers my Final Standing Order.

On top of that one individual, I also know... (1) The 24-year old stripper that lives a double-life as a prostitute and drug addict (2) A convicted bank robber from Minnesota that now lives here (3) Numerous former and current military personnel (4) Multiple disgraced former Law Enforcement Personnel (5) A FBI Informant in the financial crimes sector (I hope he is doing well in NY, lost contact in 2013) (6) A welcome meet-and-greet with Marcus Hutchins at DEFCON 2017 (he introduced himself as "Mark") prior to his arrest due to some sort of ongoing case that made national headlines (7) A serial con-man that divorced his wife while marrying a new one and brought back from the Phillipines (I am friends with Britney, his pissed off ex-wife that wants to collect damages via court process to this day), and 

**(8) A entire "dysfunctional family" of former drug dealers, miscreants, thugs in my circle that I still talk to at this day** (it's not violating probation unless they are also felons and still doing illicit activity). The only commonality that we shared, was that we did drugs together dating back to the late 2010s, in the same garage. We fight one another. We make up right after. Then fight again. And when our local playboy came back from a nightclub with blood gushing out of his eye-socket, we immediately banded together to back him up. Since I wasn't a ringleader in this circle, it was another guy, the most unlikely short-Asian you'd ever suspect (the guy who got punched was the older brother). "We got 12 guys in this garage ready to beat your ass right now", I remembered those words he spoke over the phone to the dude (supposedly chubby according to the fast-flying words in the spot) that sucker-punched our "little pervert". But he is family too.

For this dysfunctional family, they are in varying levels of good prospects or everyday ups-and-downs today. Nothing extraordinary like marriage or college graduation however. But, they are trying. And they do not have to deal with the burden of the constant harassment that I am facing without refuge.

Surprisingly, only the ones with a illustratrious military background seemed to be "making it". Everyone else is in some circle of hell right now.

**LEOs, don't bother pursuing my former inner circle. They have done nothing wrong, and they have been living boring lives for the last few years.**

# Weeping Angel

In my first FBI case against me in 2016, I was one of the first witnesses of "Weeping Angel", the surveillance technique leaked by WikiLeaks.

**My creepy Syrian neighbor downstairs (at Tropicana Royale Apartments, old place) had this Samsung TV that keeps connecting to my router**. I was wondering why he was so eager to share with me so many seasons of CSI (I was worried it was gay porn) and connecting to my network without knowing my pre shared key.

At great risk to the integrity of my butthole, I confronted him about it. He denied knowing anything and I never realized it until after the story broke recently.

I did however, have the habit of putting tape on top of my webcam on my old Asus laptop. Also confiscated by the feds. One unexpected flash while recovering from my dick surgery was all it took. It was quite painful, on my bed, learning and rolling back over towards my laptop sitting on top of a flipped-over laundry basket.

**Yes I have had dick surgery**. 5,000 worth of adult circumcision payable by Obamacare. I used to walk with a cane on campus. I am also prone to violently swing it at people that honk at me while I am crossing the street during those months.

I hope to never have to walk with a stick ever again. The feeling of weakness. The pain inside of my recovery cup. The fragments of dead skin floating in my hot salt bath.

Week three is the worst. The secretions from my severed frenulum cakes into a disgusting, yellow, painful mass. It took three days of bathing before I watched it float into the drain.

**When Nadia saw my dick for the first time years later. She thought I had a STD because it wasn't tanned like the rest of my balls**. Funniest shit ever. I think my porn videos caught the remark so ROFLMAO as much as you like FBI.

"Oh _____!" *My face buried in her ass*

"Oh _____!"

"Ooooooh ______!" *Nadia's tongue wags on camera*

ROFLMAO and point at my Halo in heaven.

Please append the tapes together and put it up on pornhub. And make a shrine where my ashes are scattered. I want it as a Spring Break Party Spot in California along the pier.

But I will certainly not be "pimped around" by the Feds into performing free work at the cost of my personal freedom and foreseeable future. All because of some sex tape.

# Wanna know a few tricks in hiding from my sight?

Do not ever say or discuss the following words and/or topics within my vicinity.

1. "Hacking"
2. "Cybersecurity"
3. "IT"
4. "Payment card industry"
5. "Malware"

I will not talk of any such topics with some stranger.

Furthermore, STOP BUYING WHITE UNDERCOVER CARS!!!!

What, the, fuck dude. I can actually tell how many people are watching me if people violate my first request AND if I see a ton of white cars parked NEXT to each other. Like a goddamn Enterprise Rental Parking Lot was built at this here Starbucks in just half-an-hour.

I know what is at stake here. You are pressuring me into working for you guys for free. I don't know why I would be so valuable to you. I actually do not know what would set me apart from another framed suspect. And Mr. Hutchins IS INNOCENT isn't he?

Go get a PowerPoint out or something and go explain it to me. Because I don't fucking know why you are picking on me for the last half a year.

# While we are at it...

I am going to officially announce the closure of my firm in a later time. Since the formation of the company, I felt the strange, and eerie sensations of being followed and judged. Like a sword being hung over my head. I was being watched since I created my company. The company name is literally, a liability that scares people away because they think we are unethical.
