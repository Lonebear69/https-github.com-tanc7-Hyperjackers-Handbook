# What is a Hyper-Jacker?

Hyper-Jackers or "acts of Hyper-Jacking" is the deliberate theft of a virtual machine instance, commonly a massive server or array in the cloud worth billions and holds the processing power of thousands of webservers. 

The equivalent to stealing a Cloud Hypervisor is conquering a entire planet.

Yet as of this year in 2018, people are NOT AWARE of the threat of the Cloud. And yet, Hyperjackers that control at least one of these massive mainframes already exist. I am not kidding.

# What I Offer to You, the Defense Against the Dark Arts of Hyperjacking -Course.

To Raise aware on the dangers of Hyperjacking and Docker Container Boosting attacks, I, Chang Tan of Lister Unlimited (dba) offer a free Hyperjacking Class on how to..

1. Commit or perpetrate the act of Hypervisor Theft (Hyperjacking), including the bare basics, your first hyper-jump, reanimating your dead shell (resurrecting yourself), persisting yourself with the stolen Hypervisor. Basically, a Hyperjacker is a much stronger form of a Cracker. Hyperjackers, if you do not deprive them of their ability to resurrect themselves, will outlast even you in your real lifespan. 

2. The scope of dangers and capabilities of a well experienced Hyperjacker. How to make your presence and reign of terror "immortal". How to hyper-jump on several layers, (a) the common Network Layer Hyperjump (b) the Wireless Hyper-Jump, (c) the transmissible media Hyper-Jump (d) Firmware Hyper-Jumps


3. New abilities that set Hyperjackers a grade above malicious crackers. Powers afforded to Hyper-Jackers. A stronger form of SYSTEM LEVEL ROOT. Benefits of being closer to the bare-metal and how much power it affords you compared to your victims.
